"I read many, many books, but with most books I read, I only read the first few pages because most books aren't very good."
-Yuval Noah Harari, Author of Sapiens


“Some books shake the ground beneath you, but most books should have been articles instead.”

“Books are built out of other books."

-Tyler Cowen, Author of The Complacent Class

## Summary:

Espresso Reads is an app designed to help you quickly navigate to the high points in the nonfiction landscape.   It’s like Yelp for book passages.  

Users post book profiles featuring ‘book nuggets’, which tell you which pages contain the best a book has to offer.  Profiles are upvoted to give the user easy access to the best of the best.  Book Nugget descriptions help you refine your search so you can keep your insight rate espresso strong.

Some books are worth reading cover to cover, but often times the economic pressures of the publishing industry deliver you a few
diamonds of fresh and important insight hidden in a mountain of fluff.  Espresso Reads helps you spend less time navigating the landscape of nonfiction.  That's less time finding the right book, 
and less time finding the most worthwhile parts of a nonfiction book.  

Users can search for a particular book, find the best passages of a book, and join the conversation in the comments section.

Users can also add their own entries:
